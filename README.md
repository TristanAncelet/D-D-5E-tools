# D&D 5E tools
==============

>This repository will contain the tools I've made for DM's and players for D&D 5E fir PC and iOS (via the Pythonista3 Python IDE).

## What I plan to include

**For DM's**            |

**Battlemap Maker**     | Will be able to make simple battlemap with tiles
**Campaign Notebook**   | A note section that can hold notes by user defined categories
**A World/Country Map** | A simple map with droppable points that link to a city/note you choose

**For the rest**              |

**Character Builder/Manager** | Can Build and manage your character using the program


## Possible Future Features

**Remote Virtual Tabletop** |
